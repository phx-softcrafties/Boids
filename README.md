Boids, an artificial life simulation by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids and http://www.kfish.org/boid/pseudocode.html

TODO:
- Implement Rule 1: Boids try to fly towards the centre of mass of neighboring boids
- Implement Rule 2: Boids try to keep a small distance away from other objects (including other boids)
- Implement Rule 3: Boids try to match velocity with near Boids

DONE:
- Add velocity for Boids
- Multiple boids in a simulation


EXTRA FEATURES:
- Boids of Boids?
- Limit velocity
